Description: A comprehensive toolkit for feature selection in high-dimensional data, especially scRNA-Seq data, using
    sparse manifold decomposition (SMD) with power k-means clustering. The package implements
    multiple Bregman divergences for flexible distance metrics, supports both entropy-based
    (decision trees) and maximum margin (SVM) classification approaches, and includes
    various dimension reduction methods (PCA, spectral). Specifically designed for handling
    complex biological data, it supports various input types including sparse matrices,
    SingleCellExperiment, and Seurat objects, making it particularly suitable for
    single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.
