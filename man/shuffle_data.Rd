\title{Randomly Shuffle Feature Values}
\usage{
shuffle_data(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix with dimensions (number of data points) x (number of features)}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as X with randomly permuted values within
each column
}
\description{
Creates a copy of the input matrix where values within each feature (column)
are randomly shuffled while maintaining the marginal distribution of each feature.
}
\details{
This function performs independent random permutations of values within each
feature column. It preserves the marginal distribution of each feature while
breaking any relationships between features. Useful for generating null
distributions in feature importance analyses.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(20), ncol = 2)
X_shuffled <- shuffle_data(X)
